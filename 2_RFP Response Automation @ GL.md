# 1. Motivation & Background

> **Summary:**
>  We receive a high volume of RFP (Request for Proposal) questionnaires each year, but our sales team lacks sufficient bandwidth to respond to all of these questionnaires manually. As a result, we risk losing valuable business opportunities because completing these questionnaires is the essential first step in closing deals. To address this, we plan to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for an end-to-end workflow—covering question extraction, topic classification, and Q&A generation using internal knowledge base articles (from “Qvidian”)—thus automating and streamlining the response process.

------

## Business Context

- **Increasing Volume of RFP Questionnaires**
  - Sales teams are inundated with questionnaires as part of the proposal process for prospective clients.
  - Timely responses are critical; **delays** or **non-responses** frequently result in lost contracts or reputational damage.
- **Resource Constraints & Efficiency Gaps**
  - Manually answering each question in these large questionnaires is time-consuming.
  - Existing manual processes cannot scale effectively to meet growing volumes.
  - Risk of human error in selecting and compiling accurate answers under tight deadlines.
- **Strategic Opportunity**
  - Automating responses with LLMs can drastically **reduce turnaround times** and **improve consistency** and **accuracy** in answers.
  - By tapping into a **Qvidian-based** knowledge repository, the system can deliver **tailored** and **reliable** responses.

> **Key Pain Point:** If our sales team cannot keep pace with incoming RFPs, we miss out on potential deals and erode our brand reputation for responsiveness.

------

## Technical Rationale

- **Why LLMs for RFP Questionnaires?**
  1. Automated Question Extraction
     - Instead of manually parsing lengthy RFP documents, an LLM can identify and segment questions with minimal oversight.
     - This streamlines the subsequent processes of categorizing and answering each question.
  2. Topic Analysis & Classification
     - LLM-based classifiers can **tag** each extracted question by topic (e.g., pricing, product features, compliance), which helps route questions to the correct knowledge domain.
     - This fosters a more **modular** and **scalable** approach: new domains/topics can be added with minimal overhead.
  3. Q&A from Internal Knowledge Base (Qvidian)
     - LLMs can retrieve or generate answers by referencing a curated repository (Qvidian) that houses **approved** or **historically effective** responses.
     - Ensures **consistency** in how we address common queries and reduces the risk of providing outdated or incorrect information.
- **High-Level Objectives**
  - **Accelerate Response Times:** Automate the entire RFP questionnaire process to cut down response cycles.
  - **Improve Accuracy & Consistency:** Rely on a standardized knowledge base to minimize errors and inconsistencies.
  - **Enhance Scalability:** Allow the solution to handle spikes in RFP volumes without proportionally increasing headcount.

> **Bottom Line:** LLM-powered automation enables us to handle a growing number of RFPs without sacrificing quality or timeliness.

## Illustrative Examples of Questions

- **Financial & Ratings**
  - “What’s your A.M. Best rating?”
  - “Is your financial strength rating stable for the next fiscal year?”
- **Pricing & Negotiations**
  - “Is this price negotiable for the life market of XXX?”
  - “Do you offer volume-based pricing tiers?”
- **Product & Service Offerings**
  - “Do you provide a physical card for XXX insurance?”
  - “Can your plans be bundled with home or auto insurance?”
- **Operational & Technical Details**
  - “What management tool (e.g., Workday) do you use?”
  - “Describe your data processing and analytics workflows.”

> **Note:** Real questions can be lengthy and may include extensive context, sub-questions, or domain-specific terminology.

------

## Key Challenges

1. **Variable Question Formats & Complexity**
   - RFPs can range from simple bullet points to multi-paragraph narratives.
   - Topic classification models must handle questions that are sometimes buried in verbose text.
2. **Ensuring Answer Accuracy**
   - The LLM must be anchored to **up-to-date** content in Qvidian.
   - Mismatched or outdated answers can lead to **legal** or **compliance** risks, especially in heavily regulated industries.
3. **Handling Ambiguous or Overlapping Topics**
   - Some questions span multiple domains (e.g., pricing + technical constraints).
   - Classification and retrieval must account for overlaps or unclear boundaries between topics.
4. **Integration with Existing Knowledge Base (Qvidian)**
   - Qvidian articles must be **indexed** and **retrievable** in a format easily consumable by the LLM.
   - Maintaining synchronization between Qvidian content updates and the LLM-based system is crucial.
5. **Scalability & Performance**
   - The system should handle surges in RFP volume without latency spikes or degraded performance.
   - LLM inference can be compute-intensive; efficient deployment strategies (e.g., caching, fine-tuning, or using a retrieval-augmented approach) are required.

------

## Proposed Approach

1. **End-to-End Workflow**
   1. Question Extraction
      - Use a transformer-based model (e.g., GPT or similar) fine-tuned on RFP samples to identify question segments.
      - Generate question “snippets” that can be processed further.
   2. Topic Analysis
      - Classify each question into one or more predefined categories (e.g., pricing, compliance, product features).
      - Store these classifications to facilitate domain-specific retrieval from Qvidian.
   3. Answer Generation (Qvidian Retrieval)
      - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** A retrieval model fetches the most relevant Qvidian articles, which are then passed to an LLM for answer drafting.
      - **Answer Assembly:** The LLM composes a consolidated response, referencing the relevant knowledge base content and best practices.
   4. Human-in-the-Loop Validation (Optional)
      - For high-risk or complex questions, subject matter experts (SMEs) can review and approve AI-generated answers before final submission.
      - Continuous feedback loop to improve model performance over time.
2. **System Architecture Overview**
   - **Front-End Intake:** Upload RFP documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, online forms).
   - LLM Processing Pipeline:
     - **Extraction** → **Classification** → **Retrieval** → **Generation**
   - Qvidian Integration:
     - Maintain a robust index of articles with metadata for easy reference.
   - Review & Output Module:
     - Final responses compiled into a single, polished questionnaire response document or submission portal.
3. **Model Training & Fine-Tuning**
   - Use an existing LLM foundation model with **LoRA** or **PEFT** (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) to minimize compute overhead.
   - Augment training data with synthetic RFP questions to increase coverage for less frequent question types.

## Conclusion

> By leveraging Large Language Models for automated question extraction, topic classification, and retrieval-augmented answer generation, we can **streamline** RFP responses, **improve** overall efficiency, and **unlock** new business opportunities that would otherwise be lost due to manual bottlenecks. This project not only addresses our immediate needs for a scalable and robust solution but also sets a foundation for further AI-driven enhancements in our sales and proposal processes.



# 2. Data Sources & Preprocessing

> **Summary:**
>  In this phase, we focus on how we acquire, transform, and prepare data for the **Question Extraction** process. Our primary data sources are (1) a decade’s worth of RFP attachments (in multiple file formats) stored in an internal database, and (2) the **Qvidian** knowledge base containing over 3000k articles. Below, we outline the challenges, tools, and workflows used to clean, parse, and structure these documents for downstream tasks.

------

## 2.1 Data Sources

1. **Historical RFP Attachments**
   - Volume & Format Diversity
     - Collected over 10+ years, spanning multiple file formats (Excel, Word, PDF).
     - Some files use outdated formats (e.g., `.doc`, older `.xls` versions).
   - Partial Questionnaires
     - Not all RFP documents contain questionnaires. Many include supplementary information about the buyer’s organization, technical requirements, and other tangential sections.
   - Quality & Complexity
     - Files can be **very lengthy**, contain images or tables, and vary significantly in layout.
     - The **PDFs** are electronically generated (no handwriting or scan images), which simplifies text extraction somewhat, but layout variability remains a challenge.
2. **Qvidian Knowledge Base**
   - Maintained by a separate team with **frequent (daily) updates**.
   - Contains more than **3000** articles referencing product details, pricing guidelines, compliance frameworks, etc.
   - **Current Limitation:** Only basic keyword-based search is supported, making it less effective for semantic or contextual queries. This will be addressed in Phase 3 (Q&A with retrieval-augmented generation).

> **Note:** Although Qvidian will be central to the Q&A phase, understanding its structure and update frequency informs how we preprocess and cache relevant content for retrieval.

------

## 2.2 Key Challenges in Data Preparation

1. **Identifying Questionnaire Sections**
   - RFP documents can have **large blocks of text** with buyer-side introductions, disclaimers, or product specifications.
   - The actual questions are often buried within these larger sections, sometimes titled “Questionnaire” but just as often labeled differently or split across sections.
2. **Format Inconsistencies**
   - **Excel Workbooks** might have multiple sheets—some with relevant questions, others with reference data or charts.
   - **Word Documents** can have varying heading styles or no formal heading structure at all.
   - **Old File Versions** require conversion (`.doc` → `.docx`, `.xls` → `.xlsx`) to standardize parsing.
3. **Volume & Duplication**
   - Over a decade’s worth of data means **significant repetition** of standard questions (e.g., “What is your A.M. Best rating?”) across multiple RFPs.
   - Need a **deduplication** strategy to ensure we don’t parse or store identical questions multiple times.
4. **Noisy or Unrelated Content**
   - Some documents have entire sections unrelated to our question-extraction objectives (e.g., marketing brochures, legal disclaimers).
   - Distinguishing relevant from irrelevant text is crucial to avoid bloated processing pipelines.

------

## 2.3 Proposed Workflow

### 2.3.1 Document Parsing & Conversion

1. File Format Standardization
   - **Goal**: Convert all Excel documents to modern `.xlsx`, and Word files to `.docx`.
   - Tools:
     - Server-based conversion library to handle bulk conversions.
     - Python libraries (e.g., `python-docx`, `openpyxl`) for reading the converted files.
2. Customized Extraction
   - Excel:
     - Iterate through each worksheet and parse row/column structures.
     - Identify potential “question blocks” based on keywords (“Question”, “Answer”), or repeated patterns/layouts (e.g., Q&A columns).
   - Word & PDF:
     - Use library-based text extraction (e.g., `pdfplumber` for PDFs, `python-docx` for Word).
     - Retain headings, paragraphs, and metadata (page numbers, heading levels, etc.) for context.

> **Outcome:** A standardized textual representation of each RFP document, ready for chunking and classification.

------

### 2.3.2 Large-Chunk Identification of Questionnaire Sections

1. Chunk Windowing
   - **Approach**: Segment each document into larger blocks (e.g., 1–2 pages or 1–2 major headings) to maintain contextual coherence.
   - Why Large Chunks?
     - We first want to see if a **large chunk** is within a “Questionnaire” section. This saves time and resources by quickly filtering out irrelevant text.
2. Rule-Based + LLM Hybrid
   - Rule-Based Heuristics:
     - Look for headings such as “Questionnaire,” “Q&A,” “Questions,” or “Vendor Assessment.”
     - Check for repeated patterns like “Question:” or numbering systems (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
   - LLM Classification:
     - Prompt a model (zero-shot) to determine if the chunk is *likely* part of a questionnaire.
     - Criteria may include the presence of question-like sentences and minimal narrative or marketing text.

> **Outcome:** Only chunks flagged as “questionnaire sections” move on to more granular processing.

------

### 2.3.3 Paragraph-Level Classification for Questions

1. **Smaller Chunks (Paragraph-Level)**
   - Once a larger chunk is identified as “questionnaire,” break it down into paragraphs (or lines if paragraphs are too large).
   - We **assume** each paragraph contains at most one question, or is fully a question in itself.
2. **Binary Classification**
   - **Task**: Label each paragraph as **“True”** (a question) or **“False”** (not a question).
   - Model/Methods:
     - A lightweight LLM (LLaMa 3- 8B) fine-tuned on labeled question paragraphs.

> **Outcome:** Extracted questions—cleaned, labeled, and ready for deduplication.

------

### 2.3.4 Deduplication & Hashing

1. **Hash Map for Unique Questions**
   - After extracting question paragraphs, generate a **normalized string** (remove punctuation, lowercasing, etc.) and compute a hash (e.g.,SHA-256).
   - Maintain a **global dictionary** of `<hash: question>` pairs. If a newly encountered question’s hash matches an existing entry, skip or merge.
2. **Benefits**
   - **Storage Efficiency**: Eliminate thousands of repetitive lines from storage.
   - **Performance Gains**: Prevent redundant processing in subsequent steps (topic classification, Q&A, etc.).

> **Outcome:** A refined set of **unique** questions from the entire corpus, significantly reducing reprocessing overhead.

------

## 2.4 Potential Enhancements

- Automated Template Detection
  - Identify commonly repeated RFP templates by analyzing document structure.
  - Speed up section identification for known or standardized RFP forms.
- Metadata-Enriched Storage
  - Store each question with metadata like **document ID**, **section heading**, **industry type**, etc.
  - Facilitates advanced analytics (e.g., which industries frequently ask specific questions).

------

## 2.5 Next Steps

1. Build & Validate Document Parsers
   - Test parsing scripts on a small sample (Word, Excel, PDF) to ensure format fidelity and robust error handling.
   - Confirm that heading levels, images, and table structures are handled gracefully or intentionally skipped if irrelevant.
2. Design & Train Paragraph Classifier
   - Collect a labeled dataset of paragraphs (or sentences) for question detection.
   - Compare rule-based vs. transformer-based classifier performance.
3. Implement Deduplication Pipeline
   - Finalize hashing strategy (e.g., SHA-256).
   - Decide if near-duplicate matching is also needed (handling variations like “What is your A.M. Best rating?” vs. “What’s your AM Best rating?”).
4. Phase 3 Integration Preparation
   - Establish a data repository or pipeline to seamlessly feed the **unique questions** into **Topic Analysis** and **Q&A** (RAG) modules in subsequent project stages.

------

### Conclusion

> **Data Sources & Preprocessing** form the bedrock of our entire RFP automation project. By systematically parsing, chunking, classifying, and deduplicating questions, we ensure that the downstream steps—**Topic Analysis** and **Q&A via RAG**—operate on clean, relevant, and uniquely identified question data. This approach not only optimizes efficiency but also lays the groundwork for scalable expansion as new RFP documents and knowledge base updates emerge.



# 3. Model Architecture & Technical Approach

> **Summary:**
>  After extracting and deduplicating questions, we proceed with three core tasks: **Topic Assignment**, **Clustering for Representative Questions**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Below, we detail how each component works, what models and techniques are employed, and how they integrate into the overall system.

------

## 3.1 High-Level Flow

1. **Topic Assignment with Human-Guided Fine-Tuning**
   - Human experts label a subset of questions to create a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset.
   - A Large Language Model (e.g., **LLAMA-3 70B**) is fine-tuned to classify questions by topic.
   - Final output includes a **60+ page analysis report** on question trends, aiding strategic insights for sales and product teams.
2. **Clustering & Representative Question Selection**
   - **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)**-family embeddings are computed for each question.
   - **DBSCAN** clustering groups semantically similar questions.
   - The most **representative** question from each cluster becomes part of the test set and seeds the initial Q&A database.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**
   - Multiple retrieval methods (keyword search, naive similarity, tree-based search) feed a Reciprocal Ranking Fusion (RRF) mechanism.
   - The Qvidian knowledge base is **hierarchically structured** and used to retrieve relevant articles for LLM-based answer generation.
   - Approved Q&A pairs are stored in a **vector database**, reducing hallucination risks and improving future retrieval.

> **Key Goal:** Create a robust pipeline that quickly classifies topics, finds high-quality representative questions, and generates accurate responses by leveraging both curated Qvidian data and newly fine-tuned LLM capabilities.

------

## 3.2 Topic Assignment & Trend Analysis

### 3.2.1 Human-Labeled Dataset for SFT

1. Data Collection
   - Select a diverse subset of unique questions (from **Data Sources & Preprocessing**).
   - Each question is labeled by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) into pre-defined topics (e.g., **Pricing**, **Financial Ratings**, **Technical Tools**, etc.).
2. Fine-Tuning
   - **Model Base**: LLAMA-3 70B and another LLMs.
   - **Objective**: Align the model’s topic assignment with human-labeled ground truth.
   - **Method**: Train a classification head (or multi-class approach) on top of the LLM embeddings, or use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT/LoRA).
3. Validation
   - Split data into training and validation sets; track metrics like **F1-score** and **accuracy** per topic.
   - Gather SME feedback to refine labels where confusion arises.

> **Outcome:** The fine-tuned LLM assigns topics more accurately, reflecting **true business categories** and enabling correct routing of questions for further analysis.

### 3.2.2 Trend & Analysis Report

1. Longitudinal Trend Analysis
   - Aggregate topic frequency across all historical RFP data.
   - Identify rising topics (e.g., “Cybersecurity provisions” might show an upward trend).
2. Insights & Recommendations
   - Summarize findings in a **60+ page** detailed report, highlighting which topics are most critical or frequently requested.
   - Provide strategic advice on **knowledge base** updates or **product enhancements** based on trending queries.

> **Value:** Equips stakeholders with actionable intelligence, informing resource allocation and proactive updates to Qvidian content.

------

## 3.3 Clustering with SBERT & DBSCAN

### 3.3.1 Embedding Generation

1. Sentence-BERT Family Models
   - Transform each unique question into a **dense vector** (embedding).
   - SBERT is chosen for its **robust** sentence-level representation and **efficiency** in large-scale embeddings.
2. Preprocessing
   - Normalize text (lowercase, punctuation removal).
   - Possibly remove domain-specific stopwords if they skew semantic meaning (e.g., internal codes).

### 3.3.2 DBSCAN Clustering

1. Why DBSCAN?
   - Density-based approach that automatically determines the number of clusters.
   - Effective for **unbalanced** and **noisy** question distributions.
2. Parameter Tuning
   - **Epsilon (eps)**: Controls how close points should be to be considered a cluster.
   - **Min Samples**: Minimum number of questions to form a dense region.
   - Adjust parameters iteratively to optimize cluster quality (e.g., silhouette score).

### 3.3.3 Representative Question Selection

1. Center of Cluster
   - Identify the question that is most “central” in the embedding space (e.g., minimal average distance to others).
   - This acts as a canonical or “template” question for that cluster.
2. Initial Q&A Database
   - For each cluster, either rely on existing known answers from Qvidian or route to SMEs for **newly curated** answers.
   - Store these **representative Q&As** in the system to jumpstart future retrieval.

> **Benefit:** Consolidates repeated or near-duplicate questions, allowing a more **efficient** knowledge base that covers broad question variations with minimal redundancy.

------

## 3.4 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

### 3.4.1 Overview of Retrieval Methods

1. Keyword Search
   - Basic but fast; matches questions to Qvidian articles based on overlapping keywords.
   - Useful for well-defined terminology (e.g., “A.M. Best”).
2. Naive Similarity Search
   - Embedding-based search using SBERT or other embeddings to find semantically similar Qvidian content.
   - More robust to synonyms and paraphrasing.
3. Tree-Based Search
   - Qvidian is **hierarchically structured** (e.g., **Topic > Subtopic > Article**).
   - System navigates this tree to isolate relevant articles by topic.
   - This approach is especially strong when topic assignment from the LLM is **accurate**.

### 3.4.2 Relevance Ranking Fusion (RRF)

1. Aggregation of Scores
   - Each retrieval method outputs a relevance score.
   - RRF combines them (often by normalizing and summing or rank-based weighting).
   - Higher overall score = more confidence in the retrieved result.
2. Evaluation Metric: mAP
   - **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** used to gauge retrieval quality.
   - Tracks how well the system ranks **correct** articles near the top.

> **Outcome:** A **unified** retrieval result set that balances the strengths of each search approach, improving recall and precision in finding relevant Qvidian references.

------

### 3.4.3 Answer Generation & Storage

1. Curated Fine-Tuning for Answer Generation
   - **LLAMA-3 70B** further fine-tuned on an SME-reviewed Q&A dataset (supervised approach).
   - Ensures the model has consistent style, factual grounding, and domain knowledge aligned with corporate standards.
2. SME Review & Vector Database Storage
   - Answers generated for new or uncertain questions are **flagged** for SME review.
   - Approved Q&A pairs (with references to relevant Qvidian articles) get stored in a **vector database** (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS).
   - This approach **minimizes hallucination** risks in early stages and continually enriches the knowledge base.
3. Inference Flow
   1. **Check Similarity Threshold (0.85)**: If an incoming question’s highest similarity score to existing Q&A pairs is **≥ 0.85**, return the matched answer.
   2. **LLM Generation**: If the score is below 0.85, prompt the LLM to generate a new answer referencing the retrieved Qvidian articles.
   3. **Final Output**: Provide answer to user; optionally route to SME if the question is flagged as high-risk or novel.

> **Key Advantage:** Progressive improvement of the knowledge base, as newly verified Q&As expand coverage for future queries.

------

## 3.5 Integration & Next Steps

1. Topic Assignment & RAG Synchronization
   - Ensure the model’s assigned topic is used to **direct** the retrieval process (tree-based indexing).
   - Evaluate if misclassifications degrade retrieval quality and refine SFT or topic definitions accordingly.
2. SME Governance
   - Create **clear guidelines** for SME acceptance.
   - Track changes over time to identify high-risk areas (e.g., compliance, legal disclaimers).
3. Continuous Model Updates
   - Retrain or fine-tune embeddings, classification layers, and generative models as new data arrives.
   - Monitor **mAP**, topic classification F1-scores, and user satisfaction.

> **Overall Vision:** A **continuous feedback loop** where each new RFP question refines the system’s classification, retrieval, and generation. This ensures agility as business needs, regulations, and Qvidian content evolve.

------

### Conclusion

> By leveraging **topic-focused fine-tuning**, **clustering with SBERT and DBSCAN**, and a **multi-method RAG pipeline**, we create a **scalable**, **accurate**, and **constantly improving** solution to handle incoming RFP questions. The approach not only yields rapid and consistent responses but also generates strategic insights for further product and knowledge-base development, ensuring a powerful competitive edge in the RFP landscape.

# 4. Deployment & Infrastructure

> **Summary:**
>  This section outlines how we package and deploy our question-extraction, topic-assignment, and RAG pipeline. It also covers system architecture choices for scaling, monitoring, and ensuring smooth integration with existing enterprise workflows.

------

## 4.1 Environment & Packaging

1. **Containerization**
   - **Docker** is used to encapsulate all components (document parsing, LLM inference, RAG services) into separate containers.
   - Ensures consistent environments across **development**, **staging**, and **production**.
2. **Orchestration**
   - **Kubernetes (K8s)** manages container clusters, providing automatic scaling and failover.
   - **Kustomize** can define how each microservice is deployed and updated.
3. **Hardware Considerations**
   - **GPU Acceleration** for LLM inference (e.g., **NVIDIA A10G * 8**  instances in the cloud).
   - CPU-bound tasks (e.g., question parsing, chunking, DBSCAN clustering) can run in parallel on **high-CPU** node pools.
   - **Load Balancing** ensures traffic is routed to the healthiest, least-loaded LLM inference servers.
4. **Model Storage & Versioning**
   - **Model Registry** (e.g., MLflow or a custom solution) to store multiple LLM versions (fine-tuned checkpoints).
   - Proper version tags ensure reproducibility and rollback if a new model underperforms.

------

## 4.2 Pipeline Integration & Orchestration

1. **Document Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Triggered via a **message queue** (e.g., Kafka) or scheduled batch jobs.
   - Converts and parses documents (Phase 1 in the overall process) before passing them to the question extraction module.
2. **Microservices Structure**
   - **Question Extraction Service:** Receives text chunks, identifies questionnaire sections, extracts questions.
   - **Topic Assignment Service:** Classifies questions into topics using the fine-tuned LLM or lightweight classification head.
   - **Clustering & DB Management Service:** Periodically runs embedding generation and DBSCAN to update representative questions in the knowledge store.
   - **RAG Service:** Interfaces with the retrieval layer (keyword, similarity, tree-based) and calls the LLM for final answer generation.
3. **Data & Model Flow**
   - **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone):** Stores question embeddings and verified Q&A pairs.
   - **RRF Layer:** Aggregates multiple retrieval signals (keyword, semantic, tree-based) and ranks results.
   - **LLM Inference**: Hosted as a separate API endpoint or within the RAG service itself, depending on load and latency requirements.

------

## 4.3 Monitoring & Logging

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - **Prometheus** to capture container-level (CPU, memory usage) and application-level metrics (request counts, latency).
   - **mAP** and **F1** metrics periodically computed on test sets to ensure retrieval and classification quality remain stable.
2. **Error & Exception Handling**
   - Centralized **logging** (e.g., ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for debugging ingestion or inference failures.
   - Alerting set up for **spikes** in response errors or slowdowns in the LLM inference service.
3. **A/B Testing & Canary Releases**
   - Gradual rollout of new model versions to a subset of traffic.
   - Monitor any shifts in user-facing metrics (e.g., complaint rate) before a full release.

------

## 4.4 Security & Access Control

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use  **JWT** tokens for secure API access.
   - Restrict direct queries to the LLM inference service; internal microservices handle final interactions to prevent unauthorized usage.
2. **Data Privacy**

# 1. Motivation & Background

> **Summary:**
>  We receive a high volume of RFP (Request for Proposal) questionnaires each year, but our sales team lacks sufficient bandwidth to respond to all of these questionnaires manually. As a result, we risk losing valuable business opportunities because completing these questionnaires is the essential first step in closing deals. To address this, we plan to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for an end-to-end workflow—covering question extraction, topic classification, and Q&A generation using internal knowledge base articles (from “Qvidian”)—thus automating and streamlining the response process.

------

## Business Context

- **Increasing Volume of RFP Questionnaires**
  - Sales teams are inundated with questionnaires as part of the proposal process for prospective clients.
  - Timely responses are critical; **delays** or **non-responses** frequently result in lost contracts or reputational damage.
- **Resource Constraints & Efficiency Gaps**
  - Manually answering each question is time-consuming.
  - Existing processes cannot scale to meet growing volumes.
  - Risk of human error in selecting and compiling accurate answers under tight deadlines.
- **Strategic Opportunity**
  - Automating responses with LLMs can drastically **reduce turnaround times** and **improve consistency**.
  - By tapping into a **Qvidian-based** knowledge repository, the system can deliver **tailored** and **reliable** responses.

------

## Technical Rationale

1. Automated Question Extraction
   - An LLM can identify and segment questions from lengthy RFP documents, reducing manual parsing.
2. Topic Analysis & Classification
   - Classifies each question by topic (e.g., pricing, compliance, product features) to route to correct knowledge domains.
3. Q&A from Internal Knowledge Base
   - Uses retrieval-augmented generation for relevant, up-to-date answers from the Qvidian repository.

> **Bottom Line:** LLM-powered automation enables us to handle a growing number of RFPs without sacrificing quality or timeliness.

------

# 2. Data Sources & Preprocessing

> **Summary:**
>  We focus on acquiring, transforming, and preparing data for question extraction. Our primary data sources include 10+ years of RFP attachments stored in our internal database and the **Qvidian** knowledge base with over 3000k articles. We handle large volumes, diverse formats (Excel, Word, PDF), and significant duplication.

------

## Key Steps

1. **Customized Document Parsing**
   - Convert older `.doc`/`.xls` formats to `.docx`/`.xlsx`.
   - Extract text from Word, Excel (multiple sheets), and PDF.
2. **Chunking & Section Identification**
   - Use a **large chunk window** + rule-based solution (headings, page layout) + LLM classification to isolate **questionnaire** sections.
3. **Paragraph-Level Question Extraction**
   - Classify each paragraph as “true” (question) or “false” (not a question).
   - **~94%** accuracy on curated datasets.
4. **Deduplication with Hashing**
   - Use a hash map to skip identical questions, reducing both storage and computational overhead.

> **Outcome:** A refined and **unique** set of questions ready for topic analysis and Q&A.

------

# 3. Model Architecture & Technical Approach

> **Summary:**
>  After extracting questions, we have three core tasks: **Topic Assignment**, **Clustering & Representative Questions**, and a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.

------

   - Identifies representative questions for each cluster.
3. Q&A Database Initialization
   - Representative questions become seeds in a Q&A database.
   - SMEs review or supply answers for accuracy.

------

## 3.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

1. Multiple Retrieval Methods
   - **Keyword Search**, **Naive Similarity**, **Tree-Based** search in Qvidian’s hierarchical structure.
2. Relevance Ranking Fusion (RRF)
   - Combines each retrieval’s relevance score; final ranking evaluated with **mAP**.
3. Generation & Storage
   - **LLAMA-3 70B** fine-tuned on SME-approved Q&A.
   - Vector DB stores verified Q&A pairs, minimizing hallucination.
   - ~30% complaint rate reduced to 5% by regularly updating Qvidian articles and refining retrieval.

> **Outcome:** A robust pipeline that accurately fetches and generates answers with minimal reliance on manual intervention.
